If you've ever worked from a\n          single laptop screen, you'll know the pain: juggling tabs, jumping\n          between conference calls, emails, creative apps, documents,\n          spreadsheets, deep creative workflows and more. <br>\n          <br>\n          That's where portable monitors come in. They give you the freedom to\n          bring a second (or even third) screen with you, so you can recreate\n          your desktop setup anywhere, without compromise. <br>\n          <br>\n          We also know that having the freedom to get up, move between work\n          locations, or even set up to get inspired in different locations, can\n          make a world of difference to how you immerse yourself in your work.\n          <br>\n          <br>\n          For business travellers and professionals on the move, compromises to\n          performance when working on the road should be minimal…. that's where\n          espresso Displays come in.\n          <br>\n          <br> In short, more space at your fingertips, anywhere."
